# Aquaponic Cycling Tracker
:fish: :four_leaf_clover: :tropical_fish:
-- With a D3.js version 5, multiline line graph visualisation in React/Redux --


Please check [out](https://aquaponic-cycler.herokuapp.com) a working version. 


If you are cycling an Aquaponic System you can make an account and start tracking right away.
If you have :question:, :beetle: or feature requests I'm at @FishPlantFish on twitter

If you have found your way here, you are likely looking for **D3 v5 multi-line-graph** :chart_with_upwards_trend:. I was unable to find anything else like it online, so feel free to copy pasta :spaghetti:

You can find it in src/components/D3LineGraph.js. Note the default props at the base of the file, you can pass in your own if you like.

:warning: the nature of using the D3 library in react leads to some heavy React components that can be hard to follow. 
I recommend spending some time with a basics of d3 course before diving right in.
