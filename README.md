### D3.js version 5, multiline line graph visualisation in react
### built in react/redux with D3,js for visualisations. Using firebase firestore as db, running a node express server through heroku

Please check it [out]!(https://aquaponic-cycler.herokuapp.com)! (working version)

If you have found your way here, you are likely looking for D3 v5 multiline graph :chart_with_upwards_trend:. I was unable to find anything else quite like it online. 
:warning: the nature of D3 in react leads to some heavy components that can be hard to follow. I recommend spending some time with a basics of d3 course before diving right in. 

You can find it in src/components/D3LineGraph.js -> feel free to copy pasta :spaghetti:
